# Prerequisites for Defender for IoT

<!--[Items to include in this and other articles] Passive or active discovery using your MDE Establishing site-based RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)-->
Defender for IoT monitors and secures network traffic across your OT networks. To see how Defender for IoT can help your network you can sign up to a free, 90 day, trial version. This article describes the prerequisistes needed to set up a trial license for Microsoft Defender for IoT, for customers who don't have a Microsoft tenant at all.

A trial supports a **Large** sized site with up to 1,000 devices, and lasts for 90 days. You might want to use this trial with your existing OT devices to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, understand network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.
