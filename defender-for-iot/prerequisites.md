# Prerequisites for Defender for IoT

This article discusses the items needed prerequisites .....
<!--[Items to include in this and other articles] Passive or active discovery using your MDE Establishing site-based RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)-->
[If this article includes the trial license keep this intro, if the license is in the getting started article this should be rewritten - LW]
This article describes how to set up a trial license of Microsoft Defender for IoT, for customers who don't have a Microsoft tenant at all [ is this correct?]. Use Defender for IoT to monitor and secure network traffic across your OT networks.

A trial supports a **Large** site size with up to 1,000 devices, and lasts for 90 days. You might want to use this trial [ with a [virtual sensor](tutorial-onboarding.md) or on-premises sensors  - REMOVE] with your existing OT devices to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, understand network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.

For more information, see [Free trial](billing.md#free-trial). [REMOVE this just repeats the same information and goes around and around. Should any of this be rewritten]

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you need:

1. An email address to be used as the contact for your new Microsoft Tenant.
1. A Global [or Billing - ADD?] Admin permissions (Entra ID role on the tenant) [do we want this link?  [Entra](entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference.md#global-administrator) ].<!--1. A Microsoft 365 tenant, with access to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/catalog) as Global or Billing admin.-->

    For more information, see [Buy or remove licenses for a icrosoft business subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses) and [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

1. Credit card details for your new [Azure - REMOVE] subscription, although you aren't charged until you switch from the **Free Trial** to the **Pay-As-You-Go** plan.
1. An understanding of your site size. For more information, see [Calculate devices in your network](best-practices/plan-prepare-deploy.md#calculate-devices-in-your-network). [waiting for update to this from Belle [link to here](get-started.md#calculate-number-of-devices)].

This article is relevant for commercial Defender for IoT customers. If you're a government customer, contact your Microsoft sales representative for more information. [Is there a link for this? or not needed?]
