# Prerequisites for Defender for IoT

Defender for IoT monitors and secures network traffic across your OT networks. To see how Defender for IoT can help your network you can sign up to a free, 90 day, trial version. This article describes the prerequisistes needed to set up a trial license for Microsoft Defender for IoT, for customers who don't have a Microsoft tenant at all.

A trial supports a **Large** sized site with up to 1,000 devices, and lasts for 90 days. You might want to use this trial with your existing OT devices to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, understand network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.

## Prerequisites for a trial license

Before you start, you need:

1. An email address to be used as the contact for your new Microsoft Tenant.

1. A Microsoft 365 tenant, with access to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/catalog) as Global or Billing admin.

    For more information, see [Buy or remove licenses for a Microsoft business subscription](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/buy-licenses) and [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

1. Credit card details for your new subscription, although you aren't charged until you switch from the **Free Trial** to the **Pay-As-You-Go** plan.

1. We recommend you have IP or MAC address details of at least one OT device at the site.
