A trial supports a **Large** site size with up to 1,000 devices, and lasts for 90 days. You might want to use this trial [ with a [virtual sensor](tutorial-onboarding.md) or on-premises sensors  - REMOVE] with your existing OT devices to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, understand network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.

For more information, see [Free trial](billing.md#free-trial). [REMOVE this just repeats the same information and goes around and around. Should any of this be rewritten]
