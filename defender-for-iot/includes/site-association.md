>Currently, in the Defender XDR portal, devices are discovered and associated with sites created in Site Security using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. In Azure, devices are discovered and associated with a site using the Defender for IoT network sensors. Sites created in the different portals aren't synchronized yet and there could be differences between the list of devices discovered by Azure and the Defender XDR portal. <!-- (We plan to enable the association of devices discovered by both MDE and Network Sensors in the Defender XDR portal in the near future.) - Limor do we also want to add this, Amit wasnt sure> -->
