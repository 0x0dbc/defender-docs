# What is Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Defender portal (Preview)?

The Internet of Things (IoT) supports billions of connected devices that use both operational technology (OT) and IoT networks. IoT/OT devices and networks are often built using specialized protocols, and might prioritize operational challenges over security.

Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Defender portal is a unified security solution built specifically to identify IoT and OT devices, vulnerabilities, and threats. Use Defender for IoT to secure your entire IoT/OT environment, including existing devices that might not have built-in security agents.

In this article, you learn how Defender for IoT and secures your OT environments, solving these challenges.

## Who uses Defender for IoT?

Defender for IoT is intended for:

- **CISOs** or security leaders that want to gain an overview of their organization's OT network and security.
- **OT security admins, industrial engineers, risk managers, and SOC analysts​** that want to gain a high-level view of a site's risks, incidents, and vulnerabilities, get recommendations for remediation actions, manage and discover protected OT devices, and more.

## What are the main OT security challenges?

OT network challenges include: poor visibility into assets and networks, difficulty to create network segmentation, vulnerable legacy systems, dependence on external vendors, and lack of security expertise. When OT devices can't be protected by traditional security monitoring systems, each new wave of innovation increases the risk and possible attack surfaces across those networks.

Microsoft Defender for IoT in the Defender portal is built specifically to extend your protection to OT networks, including discovery of OT devices, vulnerabilities, and threats.

## How does it work?

Defender for IoT in the Defender portal uses the following combination of technology built into Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Microsoft's cloud service:

- **Endpoint network sensors**: Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process IoT/OT network signals and send sensor data to your cloud tenant.

- **Cloud security analytics**: Leveraging big-data and device learning, network signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.

- **Threat intelligence**: Generated by Microsoft OT security research teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Defender for IoT to identify IoT/OT attacks and techniques and generate alerts when they are observed.

## What are the main Defender for IoT use cases?

|Use case  |Capabilities  |
|---------|---------|
|**[Discover OT devices](manage-devices-inventory.md)**     |Gather OT network data from Microsoft Defender for Endpoint; identify and  manage OT devices.  |
|**[Get an overview of your productions sites (site security)](site-security-overview.md)** |Get an overview of your production sites to gain insights into OT risks, make better-informed security investment decisions​, and streamline communication between stakeholders. |
|**[Prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities](discover-vulnerabilities.md)**     |Proactively manage OT network risks based on vulnerability details and recommended remediation advice.  |
|**[Analyze incidents](investigate-threats.md) and respond to threats**     |Review incidents and alerts with real-time details about events logged in your OT network and take recommended remediation actions. |
|**Extend Microsoft Defender XDR**     |Microsoft Defender XDR and Defender for IoT form a unified pre- and post-breach enterprise defense suite. This suite natively integrates across endpoint, IoT/OT, identity, email, and applications to detect, prevent, investigate, and automatically respond to sophisticated attacks. |
