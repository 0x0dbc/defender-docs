# Discover vulnerabilities

With vulnerability management, Microsoft Defender for IoT provides extended coverage for OT networks, gathers OT device data into one place, and displays the data with the other devices on your network.

In this article, you learn how to investigate vulnerabilities and take recommended remediation actions.
