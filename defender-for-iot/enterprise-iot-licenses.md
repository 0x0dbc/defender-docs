# Set up and manage enterprise IoT security licenses

Enterprise IoT security improves the monitoring and protection of the IoT devices in your network, such as printers, smart TVs, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) devices, conferencing systems and purpose-built, proprietary devices. The security monitoring includes IoT related alerts, vulnerabilities, and recommendations that are integrated with your existing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint data.

## Enterprise IoT licenses

To add enterprise IoT security to Defender for Endpoint, there are two options available depending on your existing license:

1. Customers with Microsoft 365 E5 (ME5) or E5 Security plans already have enterprise IoT available, but just need to turn on the feature. Each license supports five devices per ME5/ E5 Security license.

    To turn on enterprise for IoT, see [ME5/ E5 Security customers](enterprise-iot-get-started.md#me5-e5-security-customers).

    To turn off enterprise for IoT, see [turn off enterprise IoT security](enterprise-iot-manage.md#turn-off-enterprise-iot-security).<!-- this instead of the disable enterprise IoT below??-->

1. Customers with a Defender for Endpoint P2 license only can use a trial standalone license for monitoring enterprise IoT devices. A trial license supports 100 devices.

    Start your enterprise IoT trial using the [Microsoft Defender for IoT - EIoT Device License - add-on wizard](https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?products=b2f91841-252f-4765-94c3-75802d7c0ddb&ali=1&bac=1) or via the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/catalog).

    When the trial ends, the trial license is automatically canceled, and you lose access to enterprise IoT security features. To continue using enterprise IoT purchase a full standalone license. For more information, see [purchase a standalone license](enterprise-iot-get-started.md#set-up-a-standalone-full-license).

## Disable enterprise IoT

Customers with ME5/E5 Security plans who no longer need the enterprise IoT security can turn off the feature. For more information, see [Turn off enterprise IoT security](enterprise-iot-manage.md#turn-off-enterprise-iot-security).

## End of trial period

Customers with a Defender for Endpoint P2 license who don't add a standalone license by the time the trial ends, have the trial automatically canceled, and lose access to enterprise IoT security features.

For more information, see [purchase a standalone license](enterprise-iot-get-started.md#purchase-the-standalone-license).
