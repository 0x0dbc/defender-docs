# Enterprise for IoT in the Defender portal

The number of IoT devices continues to grow exponentially across enterprise networks in many office buildings. Enterprise IoT devices include devices such as printers, smart TVs, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) devices, conferencing systems and purpose-built, proprietary devices. For more information, see [Defender for IoT devices](billing#defender-for-iot-devices) <!-- do we have an equivalent to this?-->

While the number of IoT devices continues to grow, they often lack the security safeguards that are common on managed endpoints like laptops and mobile phones. To bad actors, these unmanaged devices can be used as a point of entry for lateral movement or evasion, and too often, the use of such tactics leads to the exfiltration<!-- should this be changed to hacking / exposure/ stealing / leaking --> of sensitive information.

Extend Defender for IoT's agentless<!-- I presume this is different in Defender and does use agents --> security features to include enterprise IoT devices. Add the enterprise IoT security feature to your existing Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- license? or remove to your?-->, and view related alerts, vulnerabilities, and recommendations for IoT devices in Microsoft Defender.

Microsoft Defender for IoT seamlessly integrates with Microsoft Defender XDR<!-- remove XDR?--> and Defender for Endpoint to both discover IoT devices and provide security value, including purpose-built alerts, recommendations, and vulnerability data.

## What is the difference between OT and Enterprise IoT?

- Operational Technology (OT): OT network sensors use agentless, patented technology to discover, learn, and continuously monitor network devices for deep visibility into Operational Technology (OT) / Industrial Control System (ICS) risks. Sensors carry out data collection, analysis, and alerting on-site, making them ideal for locations with low bandwidth or high latency.
- Enterprise IoT: Enterprise IoT provides visibility and security for IoT devices in the corporate environment.
Enterprise IoT network protection extends agentless features beyond operational environments, providing coverage for all IoT devices in your environment. For example, an enterprise IoT environment might include printers, cameras, and purpose-built, proprietary, devices.

## Manage enterprise IoT monitoring support with Microsoft Defender for IoT

For Enterprise IoT networks, use a trial, standalone<!--?--> license for 90 days as an add-on to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!--?-->. A trial license support 100 devices. There are two options available depending on your existing license:

1. Customers with ME5/E5 Security plans have support for enterprise IoT monitoring available, and don't need to start a trial.

    To turn on Enterprise for IoT [follow these instructions](enterprise-for-iot-get-started.md#turn-on-enterprise-iot-monitoring).

1. Customers with a Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 license only can use a trial standalone license for enterprise IoT monitoring.

    Start your enterprise IoT trial using the [Microsoft Defender for IoT - EIoT Device License - add-on wizard](https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?products=b2f91841-252f-4765-94c3-75802d7c0ddb&ali=1&bac=1) or via the Microsoft 365 admin center. <!-- is this correct?-->

A permanent Enterprise IoT monitoring license supports five devices per Microsoft 365 E5 (ME5) or E5 Security license, or is available as a standalone, per-device license for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 customers.

### How can I cancel Enterprise IoT?

For more information, see [Turn off enterprise IoT security](enterprise-for-iot-get-started.md#turn-off-enterprise-iot-security).

### What happens when the trial ends?

If you haven't added a standalone license by the time your trial ends, your trial is automatically canceled, and you lose access to Enterprise IoT security features.

For more information, see [Defender for IoT subscription billing](billing.md).<!-- ?-->

### How can I resolve billing issues associated with my Enterprise IoT plan?

For any billing or technical issues, open a support ticket for Microsoft Defender XDR.<!-- ?-->

## Alerts
<!-- here Enterprise was written with a capital and I have lowered that-->
Most Defender for Endpoint alerts <!--network-based detections -->are also relevant for enterprise IoT devices, such as alerts for scans involving managed endpoints. Alerts for enterprise IoT devices detected by Defender for Endpoint are only available in Defender for Endpoint only<!-- where are they now available? -->.

For more information, see [Alerts queue in Microsoft 365 Defender](/defender-endpoint/alerts-queue.md). <!-- should this be changed? what alternatives are there? also change to in Microsoft Defender portal? Amit-->

## Recommendations

The following Defender for Endpoint security recommendations are supported for Enterprise IoT devices:

- Require authentication for Telnet management interface
- Disable insecure administration protocol â€“ Telnet
- Remove insecure administration protocols SNMP V1 and SNMP V2
- Require authentication for VNC management interface

## Vulnerabilities

Known CVEs vulnerabilities are detected and showing in the Defender portal associated with the relevant device. Known CVEs can help you decide whether to patch, remove, or contain the device and mitigate risk to your network. Alternatively, use advanced hunting queries to collect vulnerabilities across all your devices.
