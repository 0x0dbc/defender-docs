# Device discovery in Defender for IoT

The device inventory helps you identify details about specific devices, such as manufacturer, type, serial number, firmware, and more. Gathering details about your devices helps your teams proactively investigate vulnerabilities that can compromise your most critical assets.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you don't yet have a Defender for IoT license, the Device inventory page lists OT devices without security data. For example, the device name, IP, and category are visible, while the risk level isn't visible. A note is also visible at the top of the **Device inventory** page that indicates the number of unprotected OT devices.
> 
> In this case, [onboard Defender for IoT](get-started.md) to get security value for your OT devices.

## Device discovery capabilities

- **Manage your IoT/OT devices** by building up-to-date inventory that includes all your managed and unmanaged devices. Classify critical devices to ensure that the most important assets in your organization are protected.​

- **Protect devices with risk-based approach** to identify risks such as missing patches, vulnerabilities and prioritize fixes based on risk scoring and automated threat modeling

- **Update your inventory** by deleting irrelevant devices and adding organization-specific information to emphasize your organization preferences

- **Attach devices to physical sites** to allow contextual security monitoring. Use the **Site** filter to manage each site separately. Learn more about [filters](/defender-endpoint/machines-view-overview.md#use-filters-to-customize-the-device-inventory-views). ​

- **Create device groups** to allow different teams in your organization to monitor and manage relevant assets only.​ Learn more about [creating a device group](/defender-endpoint/machine-groups.md#create-a-device-group).
