# Get started with Defender for IoT

intro lines

## Add a trial license

This procedure describes how to add a trial license for Defender for IoT. One trial license is available per tenant.

To add a trial license with a new tenant, we recommend that you use the Trial wizard. If you already have a tenant, use the Microsoft 365 Marketplace to add a trial license to your tenant.

# [Add a trial with the Trial wizard](#tab/wizard)

**To add a trial license with a new tenant**:

1. In a browser, open the [Microsoft Defender for IoT - OT Site License (1000 max devices per site) Trial wizard](https://signup.microsoft.com/get-started/signup?products=d2bdd05f-4856-4569-8474-2f9ec298923b).

1. In the **Email** box, enter the email address you want to associate with the trial license, and select **Next**.

1. Confirm that the email address is correct by selecting **Set up account**.

1. In the **Tell us about yourself** page, enter your details, and then select **Next**.

1. Select whether you want the confirmation message to be sent to you via SMS or a phone call. Verify your phone number, and then select **Send verification code**.

1. After receiving the code, enter it in the **Enter your verification code** box.

1. In the **How you'll sign in** page, enter a username and password and select **Next**.

1. In the **Confirmation details** page, note your order number and username, and then select **Start using Microsoft Defender for IoT - OT Site License (1000 max devices per site) Trial** button to continue. We recommend that you copy your full username to the clipboard as you need it to access the Azure portal.

# [Add a trial from the Microsoft 365 Marketplace](#tab/marketplace)

**To add a trial license with an existing tenant**:

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/Home#/catalog) **Billing > Purchase services**. If you don't have this option, select **Marketplace** instead.

1. Search for **Microsoft Defender for IoT** and locate the **Microsoft Defender for IoT - OT site license - Trial Trial** item.

1. Select **Details** > **Start free trial** > **Try now** to start the trial.

Belle - why are we documenting this for a trial license? Doesnt that come with a fixed size and time lenght. This should only be for later on when I am setting the fulll permanatnt license. for a trial version - how can we choose the devices if my site has more than the max of the trial license?


## What next

[Set up a new site](set-up-sites.md).
Buy a permanant license <!-- when and where do we need to add or discuss a permanant license? Can we wait until the next stage to add this information? How will it be done? -->
