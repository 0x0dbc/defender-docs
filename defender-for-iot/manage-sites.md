# Manage sites

Once a site is in use, you might need to edit or delete the site information listed in the Site security table.
Microsoft Defender for IoT uses *sites* to group Operational Technology (OT) devices located at a specific physical location, such as an office or factory building. The Site security dashboard allows the CISO and SOC analyst an at-a-glance view of the most important security issues affecting your network to make quick, highly informed decisions about which security problems need of an immediate response.
