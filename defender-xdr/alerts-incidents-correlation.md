# Alerts, incidents, and correlation in Microsoft Defender XDR

In Microsoft Defender XDR, ***alerts*** are signals from a collection of sources that result from various threat detection activities. These signals indicate the occurrence of malicious or suspicious events in your environment. Alerts can often be part of a broader, complex attack story, and related alerts are aggregated and correlated together to form ***incidents*** that represent these attack stories.

Here is a summary of the main attributes of incidents and alerts, and the differences between them:

**Incidents:**
- Are the main "unit of measure" of the work of the Security Operations Center (SOC).
- Display the broader context of an attack.
- Represent "case files" of all the information needed to investigate the threat and the findings of the investigation.
- Trigger automatic series of responses to the threat.
- Record all activity related to the threat and its investigation and resolution.

**Alerts:**
- Represent the individual pieces of evidence that are essential to understanding and investigating the incident.
- Can be analyzed by themselves to add value when deeper analysis is required.
- Can trigger automatic mini-investigations and responses to minimize the potential threat impact.

## Alert sources

Microsoft Defender XDR alerts can come from many sources:

- Solutions that are part of Microsoft Defender XDR
    - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
    - Microsoft Defender for Office 365
    - Microsoft Defender for Identity
    - Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
    - The app governance add-on for Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps
    - Microsoft Entra ID Protection
    - Microsoft Data Loss Prevention.  

- Other services that have integrations with the Microsoft Defender security portal
    - Microsoft Sentinel
    - Microsoft Defender for Cloud

Alerts' sources can be indicated by sets of characters prepended to the alert ID. The table shown [here](link) helps you understand the mapping of alert sources based on the prepended character on the alert.

## Incident creation and alert correlation

When alerts are generated by the various detection mechanisms in the Microsoft Defender security portal, Defender XDR places them into new or existing incidents according to the following logic:

| Scenario | Decision |
| -------- | -------- |
| The alert is sufficiently unique across all alert sources within a particular time frame. | Defender XDR creates a new incident and adds the alert to it. |
| The alert is sufficiently related to other alerts&mdash;from the same source or across sources&mdash;within a particular time frame. | Defender XDR adds the alert to an existing incident. |

The criteria Microsoft Defender uses to correlate alerts together in a single incident are part of its proprietary, internal correlation logic. This logic is also responsible for giving an appropriate name to the new incident.

## Incident correlation and merging

Microsoft Defender XDR’s correlation activities don’t stop when incidents are created. Defender XDR continues to detect commonalities and relationships between incidents, and between alerts across incidents. When two or more incidents are determined to be sufficiently alike, Defender XDR merges the incidents into a single incident.

### How does Defender XDR make that determination?

Defender XDR’s correlation engine merges incidents when it recognizes common elements between alerts in separate incidents, based on its deep knowledge of the data and the attack behavior. Some of these elements include:

 - Entities&mdash;assets like users, devices, mailboxes, and others
 - Artifacts&mdash;files, processes, email senders, and others
 - Time frames
 - Sequences of events that point to multistage attacks

### When are incidents *not* merged?
