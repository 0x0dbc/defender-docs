# Review and manage remediation actions in automated investigation and response (AIR) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2](mdo-about.md#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), automated investigation and response (AIR) often results in pending remediation actions. For example:

- Soft deleting email messages or clusters.
- Turning off external mail forwarding.

These remediation actions aren't automatically done; they need to be approved by a member of your security operations (SecOps) team. The rest of this article explains how to approve or reject pending remediation actions.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend reviewing and approving or rejecting pending remediations actions as soon as possible so your automated investigations complete in a timely manner.
>
> The system checks for duplicate or overlapping investigations where the same clusters were approved multiple times. If the same investigation cluster was already approved within the previous hour, new duplicate remediations aren't processed again. This behavior doesn't remove duplicate investigations or investigation evidence, it simply de-duplicates approved actions to improve remediation processing speed. For duplicate approved cluster investigations, you don't see the action details the fly from the **History** tab on the **Action center** page in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/action-center/history>.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

To see the permissions and licensing requirement for AIR, see [Required permissions and licensing for AIR](air-about.md#required-permissions-and-licensing-for-air).

## Approve (or reject) pending actions

There are four different ways to find and take auto investigation actions:

- [Incident queue](https://security.microsoft.com/incidents)
- Investigation itself (accessed via Incident or from an alert)
- [Action center](https://security.microsoft.com/action-center/pending)
- [Investigation and remediation investigations queue](https://security.microsoft.com/airinvestigation)

## Approve or reject pending actions from the Incidents page

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to the **Incidents** page at **Incidents & alerts** \> **Incidents**. Or, to go directly to the **Incidents** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/incidents>.
2. If it helps, filter the results on the **Incidents** page by **Pending action**:
   1. Clear any existing unwanted filters on the **Incidents** page by selecting :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-remove-selection-icon.png" border="false"::: **Clear**.
   2. Select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Add filter**.
