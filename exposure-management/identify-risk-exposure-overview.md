# Identify risk and exposure across the organization

[!INCLUDE [prerelease](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

Identifying risk and exposure and finding vulnerabilities is an ongoing, changing, challenge for security teams. The Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) framework is a way to allow security teams to continuously improve, adapt, and commit to proactive cybersecurity. Cybersecurity that aligns to business outcomes, and identify an organization's specific risks. Microsoft Security Exposure Management supports CTEM by providing a way to see your organization's risk and exposure from the point of view of an attacker. It also identifies the greatest threats to the organization and the threats that are most likely to be exploited. Security Exposure Management provides the following tools and capabilities to support the CTEM process:

- Dashboards that allow security teams to identify key risks and exposures on a continuous basis.
- Recommendations on how to remediate identified risks.
- A way to customize initiatives to focus on key organizational risks and to highlight risks that are most important to the security of the organization.

Security Exposure Management supports CTEM improvement by holistically addressing weaknesses and meeting the specific organizational vulnerability challenges and exposure. The following sections explore identifying risk exposure more in depth:

- [Estimate overall risk and exposure](exposure-insights-overview.md)
- [Optimize security domains and protect against threats](initiatives.md)
- [Prioritize exposure items](exposure-insights-overview.md)
- [Secure score](secure-score.md)

<!-- take a look for XSPM specifically
Security program management: Expand the security initiatives catalog by incorporating strategic measures aimed at enhancing cybersecurity, optimizing teams' return on investment in existing security measures, and promoting the adoption of Microsoft security tools for potential upsell opportunities. 

Risk management customization: Offer tools for tailoring exposure insights, including filters and risk exclusion/acceptance, to align with an organization's specific needs and risk tolerance, recognizing that not all organizations view risk in the same way. 

Entity level exposure: Utilize both existing and newly introduced attributes within the unified entity stores to generate comprehensive insights regarding entity exposure. These insights will enhance and strengthen the security of entities involved in various security initiatives. 

Exposure events: Continue our journey with exposure event timeline by adding new event types and allowing teams to receive email notifications when top of mind events occur. 

Effective mobilization: Enabling security teams to streamline approval processes and educating cross-functional teams on security priorities more efficiently with threat evidence and business context. -->
