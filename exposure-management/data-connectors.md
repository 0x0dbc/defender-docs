# Review non-Microsoft data connectors

[!INCLUDE [prerelease](../includes//prerelease.md)]

Data connectors allow you to connect non-Microsoft data sources for a richer, more centralized exposure management experience.

1. Navigate to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/).

1. From the Exposure management section on the navigation bar, select **Data connectors**.
1. Choose the <!--ServiceNow, Qualys, or Rapid7--> datasource and select **Connect** to enter the connection information in the service connection window. Each vendor could have different connection requirements. For instance, Rapid7 requires an API key and Endpoint information.
1. Once you enter the information requested, save the information by selecting **Connect**.
1. Once the data source is connected, you can select **Status** to review its status.
