### SOMETHING SOMETHING (Preview)

June 19, 2024

We're announcing the integration of Microsoft Copilot for Security into Defender for Cloud in public preview. Copilot's embedded experience in Defender for Cloud provides users with the ability to ask questions and get answers in natural language. Copilot can help you understand the context of a recommendation, the effect of implementing a recommendation, the steps needed to take to implement a recommendation, assist with the delegation of recommendations, and assist with the remediation of misconfigurations in code.
