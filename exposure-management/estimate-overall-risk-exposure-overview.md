Microsoft Security Exposure Management has many ways to help security decision makers estimate the overall risk and exposure their organization is exposed to on a continuous basis. Estimating risk and exposure allows security stakeholders to customize decisions based on their organizational risk profile. One tool to estimate risk and exposure is the Exposure Management Overview dashboard. The dashboard gives an overview of current risk and exposure, highlights initiatives to display, and provides a means to further examine highlighted initiatives.
