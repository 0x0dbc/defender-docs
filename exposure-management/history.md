# Track exposure management history

[!INCLUDE [prerelease](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

Microsoft Security Exposure Management uses the security event history page as a way to record event chronology and log a series of exposure events over time.<!-- this is currently only initiative/ initiative drift history is it supposed to be other items? -->

You can find Initiative drift History in [Events](https://security.microsoft.com/exposure-events) in the [Microsoft defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/). To navigate to Events, go to **Exposure Management -> Exposure Insights -> Events**. Select the initiative drift event you're interested in.

In the following image, the drift event timeline depicts a larger time span to get a sense of the score changes by date.

It's possible to explore the chronological history of exposure events by:

- exposure event timeline
- view by date range
- filter by date
- metric trend

The following image shows what metrics changes on a specific date for the exposure event.
