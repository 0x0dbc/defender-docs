# Overview of exposure insights

The Exposure insights section in Microsoft Security Exposure Management is a one-stop-shop for chief information security officers (CISO), security decision makers, risk owners, and security managers to manage exposure insights throughout the entire organization. It provides a continuous and unified posture oversight to prioritize and drive security hygiene and exposure management across the enterprise. It aggregates detection data across workloads into a single pipeline.

[!INCLUDE [prerelease](../includes//prerelease.md)]

The Exposure insights section is made up of the following capabilities:

- Security initiatives
- Security metrics
- Recommendations
- Security events

It uses Secure Score, and other benchmarks, to help meet a target score to minimize risk. <!--improve-->


## Address security insights

Security Exposure Management determines potential threats and provides a means to address them proactively. It supports your organization through:

|Capability |Description |Get Started |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Comprehensive exposure visibility** | The platform provides a single view of exposure across all security products, giving security managers a holistic understanding of their organizationâ€™s risk profile. | [Review organizational exposure](review-organizational-exposure.md)|
| **Drill-down capabilities** | Security managers can drill down into specific security programs or threats to see how exposed they are in that segment. Examining segments individually allows security managers to focus their remediation efforts on the areas of greatest risk based on business context and data. | [Improve security insights with exposure insights overview](exposure-insights-overview.md) |
|**Actionable recommendations** | The platform provides actionable recommendations for reducing exposure, helping security managers to prioritize their remediation efforts, and make the most of their resources. | [Improve security insights with exposure insights overview](exposure-insights-overview.md)  |
|**Exposure events feed** | Compiled critical exposure events are vital data for security decision-makers to monitor and respond to. These exposure events offer insights into changes in baseline conditions and emerging vulnerabilities related to your organization's assets. |  [Improve security insights with exposure insights overview](exposure-insights-overview.md) |
|**Critical Asset Identification** | The platform automatically identifies critical assets within your organization, highlighting their significance in relation to exposure and potential vulnerabilities. Users can also define their own logic for identifying critical assets in their organization. The ability to identify critical assets empowers security managers with a clear understanding of which assets are most vital to protect. This identification helps safeguard your key resources, proactively. | [Overview of identify and manage critical assets](critical-asset-management.md) |
|**Attack Path Management** | The platform effectively manages attack paths by identifying potential routes that attackers might use to access and compromise your critical assets. Security managers can proactively address these pathways, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring the safety of your organization's most crucial data and systems. This proactive approach enables you to stay ahead of potential threats and effectively safeguard your critical assets. | [Overview of work with attack paths](work-attack-paths-overview.md) |

## Consolidate insights

Consolidation happens proactively and responsively in Security Exposure Management. **Initiatives** combines different security areas, such as ransomware protection and endpoint security, optimizing existing products to assess exposure and posture. The overview of different areas, contributes to better insights.

Security teams can use the aggregated view of the security events and review changes requiring attention to keep track and effectively respond to issues. They can also gain broad visibility into different assets throughout the organization and ask intelligent, exposure-related questions about them using advanced hunting capabilities.

## Security initiatives

Security initiatives provide a means to measure the maturity of an organization's various security concerns, priorities, and threats. You can review your product specific and threat specific initiatives, customize scores, and prioritize which initiatives to see on the overview dashboard.

[Initiatives](https://security.microsoft.com/exposure-initiatives) can be accessed through the dashboard or in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) through the navigation bar under **Exposure Management -> Exposure Insights -> Initiatives**.

For more information, see [Review security initiatives](initiatives.md).

## Security metrics

Security metrics measure specific aspects of exposure with respect to a given asset. For example:

- Percent of macOS endpoints missing an endpoint security solution agent
- Percent of cloud resources with critical vulnerabilities

Metrics allow users to assess an initiative's exposure status and identify exposed areas or areas that don't meet internal standards. This information can be used to prioritize which areas to address first.
To access [Metrics](https://security.microsoft.com/exposure-metrics), go to **Exposure Management -> Exposure Insights -> Metrics**.

:::image type="content" source="./media/metrics.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the metrics page in Exposure management.":::

For more information, see [Investigate initiative metrics](security-metrics.md).

## Recommendations

The recommendations catalog serves as a centralized repository for security recommendations from various different sources. For instance, sources like Microsoft Secure Score and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Examining and addressing recommendations lets you preemptively address security risk and reduce exposure.

For more information, see [Review security recommendations](security-recommendations.md).

## Security events

Security events consolidate information about any posture management changes detected, enabling customers to make adjustments to maintain a robust security posture. It measures the score drop, or worsening in the metric status. In particular, Security events handle *Initiative score drop events* and *Metric score drop events*.

- *Metric score drop events* notify customers when there's a new exposure measured by the security metrics. They're evaluated based on the effect on the score and its weight. If there's a decrease of at least 2% since yesterday, meaning exposure grew by 2%, the change is considered a score drop event.
- *Initiative score drop events* notify customers when security initiatives decrease. We assess *Initiative score drop events* based on how it affects the score. If there's a decrease of at least 2% since yesterday, the change is classified as a score drop event.
- Security Events present and track initiative and metric score drop incidents in order to determine how they affect the organizations security posture.

To access [Events](https://security.microsoft.com/exposure-events), go to **Exposure Management -> Exposure Insights -> Events**.

## Secure Score

Secure score helps organizations:

- Report on the current state of the organization's security posture.
- Improve their security posture by providing discoverability, visibility, guidance, and control.
- Compare with benchmarks and establish key performance indicators (KPIs).

For more information, see [Microsoft Secure Score](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score.md).

Microsoft Security Exposure Management recommendations use Secure Score as one of its sources. Secure score has "Recommended actions" for a [number of products](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-secure-score.md#products-included-in-secure-score). Selecting a recommendation to review, allows you to remediate the problem in the specific product, including recommendations that derived from Secure Score. For recommendations where Secure score is relevant, if Secure score isn't active, that recommendation doesn't display.
