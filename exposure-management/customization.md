NEED FURTHER content

[!INCLUDE [prerelease](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

Microsoft Security Exposure Management provides the means to customize your organization's risk management, adapting tools to your organization's specific risk tolerance and profile. It recognizes that not all organizations view risk in the same way. Some might be more or less risk adverse, depending on specific needs.

Tools in Microsoft Security Exposure Management can be tailored to fit your organization's needs. Customizations include:
<!--this needs help-->
- Tailoring exposure insights
- risk exclusion/acceptance
- highlight key initiatives
- editing metric scores
- filters

<!-- add customization -->

## Editing metric scores
You can edit metric scores to reflect your organization's unique risk tolerence. Metric scores can be edited through:

- Editing metric value weight
- Setting initiative target score

Increasing or decreasing these values increases or reduces their impact on your score.
