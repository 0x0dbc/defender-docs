# Start using Microsoft Security Exposure Management

NEED content

[!INCLUDE [prerelease](../../includes/prerelease.md)]

To get started with Microsoft Security Exposure Management start by browsing to the [Exposure Overview dashboard](https://security.microsoft.com/exposure-overview) in the [Microsoft Security portal](https://security.microsoft.com). The Microsoft Security Exposure Management section includes the following navigation items:

- **Overview (dashboard):** The dashboard summarizes exposure management workflows, lists the most exposed metrics, and displays recent security events. It also allows easy drill-down to features like key initiatives and critical asset management.
  - **Asset criticality management:** Critical asset management allows users to manage the criticality level of assets, that Microsoft predefined as assets of interests. It also creates custom classification rules to detect critical assets.
  For more information about the dashboard, see [Review organizational exposure](review-organizational-exposure.md).
- **Attack surface**: **Exposure Maps and Attack paths** allow users to explore and investigate the identified attack paths, including in a visual way. For more information, see [Explore cross-workload attack surfaces](cross-workload-attack-surfaces.md).
- **Exposure insights:** Exposure insights provide posture oversight to help you prioritize where to focus and surface threats.
  - **Initiatives:** Initiatives or the Initiative catalog provides a full list of all initiatives and their details.
  - **Security Metrics:** Metrics or the Metrics catalog provides a full list of all metrics and their details, for all initiatives.
  - **Security Recommendations:** Recommendations or the Recommendation catalog provides a full list of all recommendations and their details, in relation to the relevant metrics and initiatives.
  - **Security Events:** Provides a chronological view of all drift events across the entire platform.
  For more information, see [Improve security insights with exposure insights](exposure-insights-overview.md).
