# Explore attack surface

[!INCLUDE [prerelease](../includes/prerelease.md)]

Attack surface management is important in helping you understand how potential threats can reach and compromise valuable assets. It does so by automatically generating and visualizing attack paths that put critical assets at risk. Attack path management empowers organizations to proactively identify, visualize, and address potential threats from attackers, reducing the risk of security breaches targeting your custom and defined critical assets. Additionally, using [cross-workload attack surfaces knowledge graph](cross-workload-attack-surfaces.md) you can proactively hunt for threats to your critical assets.

The Attack surface management section includes the following articles:

- [Enterprise exposure map](enterprise-exposure-map.md)
- [Manage cross-workload attack surfaces overview](cross-workload-attack-surfaces.md)
- [Critical asset management](critical-asset-management.md)
