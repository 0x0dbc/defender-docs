# Predefined classifications

Security Exposure Management provides an out-of-the-box catalog of predefined critical asset classifications for assets that include devices, identities, and cloud resources.

You can [review and classify critical assets](classify-critical-assets.md), turning them on and off as needed.

To suggest new critical asset classifications, use the **Feedback** button.

Current asset types are:

* [Device](#device)
* [Identity](#identity)
* [Cloud resource](#cloud-resource)

As a bare-metal hypervisor, it's providing the foundation for creating and managing virtual resources. | A compromised ESXi server can result in compromising all the virtual machines it holds. Attackers often target ESXi servers to disrupt the organization's operations by modifying, encrypting, or deleting virtual machines. |
| VMware vCenter                                               | Device                     | High                        | The VMware vCenter Server is crucial for managing virtual environments. It provides centralized management of virtual machines and ESXi hosts. If it fails, it could disrupt the administration and control of your virtual infrastructure, including provisioning, migration, load balancing of virtual machines, and datacenter automation. However, as there are often redundant vCenter Servers and High Availability configurations, the immediate halt of all operations might not occur. Its failure could still cause significant inconvenience and potential performance issues | A compromised vCenter server can result in the entire virtual infrastructure of the organization being compromised. Attackers often target vCenter servers to disrupt the organization's operations by modifying, encrypting, or deleting virtual machines, and in some cases, even their backups. |
