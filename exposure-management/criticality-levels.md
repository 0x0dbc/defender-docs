# Overview of critical asset management

In [Microsoft Security Exposure Management](microsoft-security-exposure-management.md), you can define and manage resources as critical assets.

If it fails, it may disrupt the synchronization process and user authentication, but won't immediately halt all operations as there are potential manual workarounds. However, it should be given a high priority due to its important role in hybrid cloud environments.                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | consider renaming for new Entra branding |

If it fails, it could result in authentication and encryption issues. However, given that certificates typically have a long lifespan and that there are redundant servers, the immediate impact of a failure might not be as high as with some other systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                          |

If it fails, it could result in users being unable to access essential services. This is similar to the Domain Controller in that it may have redundancy, but failure could still limit capacity assurance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                          |

However, the longer the backup server is down, the higher the risk, hence a medium classification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                          |

A failure could result in significant disruption to maintenance activities and pose a security risk, similar to the Domain Controller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                          |
