# Overview of critical asset management

In [Microsoft Security Exposure Management](microsoft-security-exposure-management.md), you can define and manage resources as critical assets.

| Classification                                               | Criticality Level | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AAD Connect                                                  | High              | The Entra ID Connect (formly known as AAD Connect) server is responsible for syncing on-premises directory data to your Azure Entra ID. If it fails, it may disrupt the synchronization process and user authentication, but won't immediately halt all operations as there are potential manual workarounds. However, it should be given a high priority due to its important role in hybrid cloud environments. |
| ADCS                                                         | High              | ADCS is critical for managing digital certificates in the network. If it fails, it could result in authentication and encryption issues. However, given that certificates typically have a long lifespan and that there are usually redundant servers, the immediate impact of a failure might not be as high as with some other systems. |
| ADFS                                                         | High              | ADFS is crucial for Single Sign-On (SSO) and web-based authentication. If it fails, it could result in users being unable to access essential services. This is similar to the Domain Controller in that it may have redundancy, but failure could still limit capacity assurance. |
| Backup                                                       | High              | While backups are crucial for disaster recovery, the immediate impact of a backup server failure is usually low, as it does not directly affect operational systems. However, the longer the backup server is down, the higher the risk, hence a medium classification. |
| Domain Admin Machines                                        | High              | These machines have elevated privileges and are critical for maintaining and managing the domain. A failure could result in significant disruption to maintenance activities and pose a security risk, similar to the Domain Controller. |
| Domain Controller                                            | High              | Released                                                     |
| Exchange                                                     | High              | Exchange server is responsible for all the mail traffic within the organization. Depending on the setup and architecture, each server might hold several mail databases that store highly sensitive organizational information. |
| SCCM                                                         | High              | SCCM is used for managing systems in a large network, including patch management, software distribution, and inventory management. If it fails, it might disrupt these management tasks but not directly impact daily operations of end users. |
| ITAdminDevice                                                | Medium            | Critical devices used to configure, manage and monitor the assets within the organization are vital for IT administration and are at high risk of cyber threats. They require top-level security to prevent unauthorized access. |
| NetworkAdminDevice                                           | NA                | Critical devices used to configure, manage and monitor the network assets within the organization are vital for network administration and are at high risk of cyber threats. They require top-level security to prevent unauthorized access. |
| Vmware ESXi                                                  | NA                |                                                              |
| SecOpsAdminDevice                                            | NA                | Critical devices used to configure, manage, monitor and respond to threats within the organization are vital for SecOps process and are at high risk of cyber threats. They require top-level security to prevent unauthorized access. |
| Vmware vCenter                                               | NA                | The VMware vCenter Server is crucial for managing virtual environments. It provides centralized management of virtual machines and ESXi hosts. If it fails, it could disrupt the administration and control of your virtual infrastructure, including provisioning, migration, load balancing of virtual machines, and datacenter automation. However, as there are often redundant vCenter Servers and High Availability configurations, the immediate halt of all operations might not occur. Its failure could still cause significant inconvenience and potential performance issues |

| Identity with Execution Permissions                          | Low               | The following identities (User, Group, Service Principal, or Managed Identity) have an Azure RBAC role assigned to them(built-in or custom), at subscription scope, which in case of compromise, provides the attacker with permissions relating to MITRE's Execution tactic, which range from executing scripts on a VM using Run Command, to executing jobs using automation accounts. |
| Identity with Persistence Permissions                        | Low               | The following identities (User, Group, Service Principal, or Managed Identity) have an Azure RBAC role assigned to them(built-in or custom), at subscription scope, which in case of compromise, provides the attacker with permissions relating to MITRE's Persistence tactic, which range from configurating Azure policies, to configuring network security groups(NSGs). |

| Confidential Azure VM                                        | High              | This rule applies to Azure confidential virtual machines. Confidential VMs provide increased isolation, privacy, and encryption, and are usually used for critical or highly sensitive data and workloads. |
| Locked VM                                                    | Medium            | This is a virtual machine that is safeguarded by a lock. Locks are used to protect assets from deletion and modifications. Usually, administrators use locks to safeguard critical cloud assets in their environment, and to protect them from accidental deletion and unauthorized modifications. |
| Azure Virtual Machine with High Availability and Performance | Medium            | This rule applies to Azure virtual machines that use premium Azure storage and are configured with an availability set. Premium storage is usually used for machines with high performance requirements, such as production workloads. Availability sets improve resilience and are often indicated for business critical VMs that need high availability. |
| Locked Azure Data Store                                      | Medium            | This is a data store which is found under a scope that is safeguarded by a lock. Locks are used to protect assets from deletion, and modifications. Usually, administrators use locks to safeguard critical cloud assets in their environment, and protect them from accidental deletion and unauthorized modifications. |
| Immutable Azure Storage                                      | Medium            | This rule applies to Azure storage accounts that have immutability support enabled. Immutability stores business data in a write once read many (WORM) state, and usually indicates that the storage account holds critical or sensitive data that must be protected from modification. |
| Immutable and Locked Azure Storage                           | High              | This rule applies to Azure storage accounts that have immutability support enabled with a locked policy. Immutability stores business data in a write once read many (WORM). Data protection is increased with a locked policy to ensure that data can’t be deleted or its retention time shortened. These settings usually indicate that the storage account holds critical or sensitive data that must be protected from modification or deletion. Data might also need to align with compliance policies for data protection. |
| Virtual Machine has a critical signed-in user                | High              | This rule applies to virtual machines protected by Defender for Endpoint, where a user with a high or very high criticality level is signed in. The signed-in user can be through a joined or registered device, an active browser session, or other means. |
| Azure Key Vaults with Many Connected Identities              | High              | This rule identifies Key Vaults that can be accessed by a large number of identities, compared to other Key Vaults. This often indicates that the Key Vault is used by critical workloads, such as production services. |
